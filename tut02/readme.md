### Chapter 2: Principles of shaping

- Shapework can not be too complex nor too vague. Finding the correct balance is difficult
- It’s rough: the work is cleary not finished yet
- It’s solved: Despite being incomplete, the main idea and function of the design is clearly laid out
- It’s bounded: The scope of the project is clearly defined. what not to do is defined to repect time and budget constraints
- Who shapes: Shape work requires a certain level of technical knowledge. The person does not need to be a programmer but must have an understanding of the system
- Shapework has no real schedule due to its nature of being unknown. This makes it hard to allocate time beforehand

### Chapter 3: Set Boundries

- Set the expectations: Make sure everyone is on the same page for the complexity of the design. The feature could be a small improvement or major redesign
- Don't be too eager to start commiting resources before considering the feasibility of a project
- Fixed time, variable scope: Fixed time means deadlines. certain tradeoff need to be made to accomodate quality vs scope. (improve what you have or add more)
- Good is relative: The best solution is always relative to your time available, without time limits there is alway a better option
- Narrow down the problem: Sometimes the request is too large. Try to figure out why the request is being made and if there is an easier way to solve the underlying issue
- Grab bag: Make sure the project is driven by a single use case and/or problem. Otherwise the scope is too broad and defining the start and end goals is difficult

### Chapter 4: Finding Elements

- Move at the right speed: Don't start with the wrong level of detail, be concrete without specifying to many details
- Breadboarding: Allows you to provide components and their connections without specifying a visual design
- Fat marker sketches: Used when 2D breadboarding will not communicate as effectivly. A fat marker sketch is a sketch made with such broad strokes that adding detail is difficult or
impossible
- Make the project more specific and concrete, but leave space for decisions and choices to be made later
- Not deliverable yet at this stage, may not be understood outside your team and can be terminated
- Adds value to the raw idea be porviding essential information

### Chapter 5: Risks and Rabbit Holes

- Potential risks or holes need to be evaluated to ensure the solution is feasible
- Explore in depth to critically identify if anything is missing or incorrect
