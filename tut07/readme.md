# Scrum Guide

## Purpose
- Initially developed for managing and developing products
- Scrum has been used for research, product development, product release, operational environments, and product sustenance
- Effective in iterative and incremental knowledge transfer

## Theory
- Based on empirical process control theory
- Scrum uses an iterative and incremental approach to optimize predictability and risk management
- Based on 
    - transparency: Significant aspects of the process must be visible to those responsible for the outcome
    - inspection: Scrum users must frequently inspect Scrum artifacts and progress toward a Sprint Goal to detect undesirable variances
    - adaptation: If an inspector determines that an aspect is outside acceptable limits and the resulting product will be unacceptable, the process must be adjusted.

- Four parts of scrum
    - Sprint planing
    - Daily Scrum
    - Sprint Review
    - Sprint Retrospective

## Scrum Team
- Comprises of:
    - Product Owner: Responsible for maximizing the value of the product. They manage the Product Backlog, ensuring clarity, order, and understanding of backlog items. 
    - Development Team: Professionals who deliver a product increment at the end of each Sprint. They are self-organizing, cross-functional, and hold collective accountability.
    - Scrum Master: A servant-leader for the Scrum Team, ensuring everyone understands Scrum theory, practices, rules, and values

## Scrum Events
- Sprint: The Sprint: A time one month or less during which usable and potentially releasable product increment is created. It has a consistent duration throughout a development effort and a new Sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous one
    - Sprints may be cancelled if the sprint goal becomes obsolete
- Sprint Planing: Addresses what can be delivered in a sprint and the work required to deliver the milestone
    -  Maximum of eight hours per one-month sprint
    - What work can be done?
    - How will the work be chosen?
- Daily Scrum/Stand-Up: A 15-minute event for the development Team to synchronize activities, discuss blockers, and create a plan for the next 24 hours
- Sprint Review: Held at the end of the Sprint to inspect the increment and adapt the backlog if needed.


The goal of the scrum is to get updates from all team members on progress, blockers and expected progress. If progress is slow, the team can use the time to finds ways to possibly optimize their efforts. The goal of scrum is too be short and simple. The scrum master is responsible for keeping Scrums structured and short. The goal of the Scrum Master is to ensure that the meeting is progressing positively and that it is also documented.

# Chapter 13 (Show Progress)

- Just because a to do list may have it's items completed it does not mean that all the work is done. It is still possible that there is work that hasn't been outlined yet
- Work is like a hill, There is uncertainty in the beginning of the until you reach the known. The beginning might need to research, venue times, where the completion might entail after the dinner is completed.
- Estimates don't show uncertainty. Prior experience can make tasks faster, novel tasks may be slower
- Managers should be able to see the status of the project without discussing it within a group or with each developer individually. They can simply view the hill chart and see the lists for each of their developers
