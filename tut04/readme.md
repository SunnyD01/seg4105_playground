## Chapter 7: Bets, Not Backlogs

- Make bets instead of maintaining backlogs.
- Backlogs tend to accumulate tasks that may no longer be relevant
- Important ideas will resurface. If an idea or issue is significant it will be recure then a cycle can be allocated to the idea


## Chapter 8: The Betting Table

- A 6 week cycle provides a standard project size for both shaping and scheduling.
- Two-week cycles (sprints) are too short to accomplish meaningful work and have a high planning overhead.
- The "betting table" is a meeting during the cool-down period where stakeholders decide on the next cycle's projects
- Potential bets are either new pitches shaped during the last six weeks or older pitches revived for consideration.
- Bets are commitments. A team is given the entire six weeks to work exclusively on that project without interruptions.
- Bets have a payout and have a cap on the downside


## Chapter 9: Place Your Bets

- There are stage in the development process
    - R&D: Exploring new ideas
    - Production: Actively building and refining.
    - Cleanup mode: Fixing and improving existing features
