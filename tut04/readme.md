## Chapter 7: Bets, Not Backlogs

- The chapter emphasizes the importance of making bets instead of maintaining backlogs.
- Backlogs tend to accumulate tasks that may no longer be relevant or timely.
- Ideas are abundant, but truly important ideas will resurface. If an idea or issue is significant, it will come back to attention, motivating the team to shape a solution and allocate time for it in the next cycle.


## Chapter 8: The Betting Table

- This chapter discusses the process of deciding which projects to schedule.
- The concept of six-week cycles is introduced. These cycles provide a standard project size for both shaping and scheduling.
- Two-week cycles (sprints) are considered too short to accomplish meaningful work and come with high planning overhead.
- The "betting table" is a meeting during the cool-down period where stakeholders decide on the next cycle's projects. The potential bets are either new pitches shaped during the last six weeks or older pitches revived for consideration.
- Bets are commitments. If a six-week period is bet on a project, the team is given the entire six weeks to work exclusively on that project without interruptions.
- The meaning of a bet is elaborated upon: bets have a payout, are commitments, and have a cap on the downside.


## Chapter 9: Place Your Bets

- The chapter advises reflecting on the current stage of a product's development and betting accordingly.
- Different modes of product development are discussed, including R&D mode, production mode, and cleanup mode.
- The chapter also provides examples and poses questions to consider when placing bets, such as "Does the problem matter?" The importance of distinguishing between the problem and the solution is emphasized.
