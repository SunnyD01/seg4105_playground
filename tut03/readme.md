## Summary

- A pitch is a direction, it does not contain fine details nor the how to 
- Water fall is not a great methodology for software development, shapeup aims to place a greater focus on specifications in a given timeframe instead of time estimates to implement a feature
- Pitches do not need to be formal, they can be about presenting a rough idea
- Anyone can write a pitch regardless of technical background
- A formal pitch should be written by a developer to make the idea more concrete, the formal pitch will help determine the next steps in teh development process
- Focues on budget instead of time estimates
- Pitches should combine many user problems into one solution that can solve the underlying issue
- The pitch is not a solution, ultimatly creating the solution with respect to time, budgets, and constraints is the job of the developer
- Shaped pitches should provide the right level of detail, enough to have a clear idea of the scope of the feature, but vague enough to allow the developer to have creative freedom on how they want to implement the feature
